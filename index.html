<h1><b>CRICKET</b></h1>
 I am <b> Learning </b> to play <b> CRICKET</b> 
  <div> 
<p> There are two teams, each team has 11 players . After the toss either the team can choose to <em>Bat</em> or<em> Bowl</em>.The team that Bats has 20 overs to bat and score runs.
Each over is 6 balls. Once the Batting team plays for 20 overs the team that was earlier Bowling has to Bat and surpass the Run that the Batting team has scored.The game is still categorised as a <b>Bat and Bowl</b> game.</p>
  </div>
Marylebone Cricket Club  also called as <a href = " http://www.lords.org/">LORDS </a> is the Oldest cricket ground located in the United Kingdon.
The Image below shows the Pavilion of the ground <img src =  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord%27s_Cricket_Ground#/media/File:Lord%27s_Pavillion.jpg" alt= "Pavilion">. 
  <h2> The 3 essential components to the grame are.</h2>

<div class = "shading">
  <div class = "BATSMAN">
    <p><b>BATSMAN </b></p>
 The batsman uses a Bat to face the bowler. He has to protect the Stumps. The ground on which the batsman run is called the Pitch.
 The Pitch is 22 yards long and every time the batsmen run between the stumps the batsman gets 1 run.
 Other means to get runs is by hiting the ball on the strsight out of the boundary which gets 6 runs, if the ball touches the ground before clearing the boundary then the team gets 4 runs.<img src =  "batsman.jpg" alt= "Batsman">

</div>

<div class = "BOWLER">
 <p><b> BOWLER</b></p>
 The bowler has to bowl 6 balls in 1 over and try to get the batsmen out, he can get the batsmen out
 in the following ways bowled,runout, catch. He can try to swing the ball or sping the ball to confuse the batsman.
 The trick is to have your fielders at proper location and then  bowl a delivery that will give you 
 the batsman wicket.<img src =  "bowler.jpg" alt= "Bowler">

</div>

<div class = "FIELDER">
 <p> <b>FIELDER</b></p>
 The Fielders job is to stop the batsmen from taking any runs and make sure to catch the ball,
 as the say <em><b> "CATCHES WIN MATCHES"</b></em>. <img src =  "fielder.jpg" alt= "Fielder">
